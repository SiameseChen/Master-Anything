                <h1>Who?</h1>
                <p>My name is Arthur, and I am a 20 year old white/asian residing in the UK. I've always felt I was stupid in school with how it was structured. While I admit I wasn't the most studious student I did try to focus in class and always found that no matter how much I told myself to focus, I would barely capture any of the information. I always thought something was wrong with me and that I'm stupid. Until lockdown happened. The first lockdown my school had we were made to self study, and I found my grades and learning ended up raising more than I thought it would. This was with the help of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">pomodoro technique</a> and <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki's</a> SRS system. We eventually entered back into school and I noticed myself slipping again, and struggling in class, even with the help of my new found techniques. The second and final lockdown happened where we moved to online lessons and I realised the way traditional classes are done does not fit with me. So I spent most of my remaining time learning about how to learn, starting with <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn" target="_blank">Barbara Oakley's Learning How To Learn</a> Course. Little did I know that these basic study techniques I've just touched upon would open many doors for me. I unfortunately focused too much on this new topic I discovered that I neglected school and I finished school with A-level graes of CDE in Physics, Chemistry and Maths respectively. Not very good. From there I started learning about how to learn from courses, to books, to research papers, and now, after nearly 2 years I have made quite a formula that works really well for me that I wish to share with you all! </p>

                <h1>Why?</h1>
                <p>While I know there are a lot of sites that give out free education like Khanacademy, FullStackOpen, ProjectOdin, Edx, etc, I wanted to create a site based on evidence-based study techniques in order to make the most out of your learning. My goal is to be able to teach anything, be it a motor skill or an academic subject quickly and with not only a high retention of the information, but be able to apply it and create new things from it. My focus on this site will be to teach what I believe to be essential skills such as psychotherapy and psychology, first aid, nutrition, exercise, sleep, personal finance, politics and more. These topics aren't considered mandatory and were either not taught, breifly touched upon, or taught plain false information in where I grew up. I plan to change that and be able to give free education to a high standard for missing skills that ought to be taught everywhere and be accessible to people of all types.</p>
